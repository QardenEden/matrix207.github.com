How just doing the first, tiny part of your idea can help you find out what you need to do to really make it a big Idea

I often have conversations with people who have a Big Idea.

They have personal experience of something (an industry, a job, a market, a personal problem), have noticed something that needs to be done, and have come up with what they think is a solution.

Then they tell me they've been working on the idea for a year or so, and pull out a text document, a presentation, and/or a diagram of how the website needs to look and work.

And they begin going into vast detail about all of the feature of the solution. It's going to do this, and then this, and it also will do this. And because this is a global problem it obviously needs to do this and this and this. And so on. A huge list. They back it up with how they've got some interest from someone important, and have had an amazing conversation with someone you've never heard of but are meant to know.

##Can I stop you there?

I suspect I come across as rude, I usually start starting into the middle distance and then suddenly cut them off mid-sentence before They've finished.

I start asking some difficult questions:

+ How long have you been working on this?
+ What are your assumptions?
+ How do you know that your assumptions are right?
+ What have you done to validate that people will really do what you think they will do rather than telling you they will?

And most importantly: why has it taken you a year to get this far and you've still got nothing on a screen?

Usually I get a bit of a blank look, some uncomfortable excuses and the I tell them a version of the following. The effect is often quite dramatic, so I thought I'd share.

##The little Big Idea

Having Big Idea is wonderful, it's to be encouraged. I'm inspired, as I'm sure you are, by people who have one and then follow through, and keep following through until they've built a company around their idea.

Have a read of Sugru's story page and you'll see exactly what it takes to make a Big Idea a reality. Seriously, that's got to be one of the best pages on the web.

Sugru is what I'd call a "Little, Big Idea". At its heart it is a very simple proposition - a Little Idea, that has potential to do something pretty Big.

Sugru is a product that lets you fix physical things that are broken, or adapt them to make them better. It's type of waterproof putty that hardens at room temperature. It's just some silicone rubber.

But when you think about what that means - less wastage, reuse before recycling, improving how we use products by adapting them to fit our needs, it's clear that it's also a Big Idea.

##Just get started

A lot of people, when they have Big Idea moment, throw themselves into writing it all down, planning it out, and doing things about the thing. Not the thing itself.

My favourite part of the Sugru story is what the founder, Jane ni Dhulchaointigh, says about the first prototype for what would become the product:
>> "If I'm honest, the first version of sugru was pretty horrible -- make from smelly silicone caulk and waste wood dust from wood workshop. But it helped me hack my kitchen sink plug bigger, and make a knife more comfortable."

That's the opposite of going for the Big Idea pitch. My usual reaction to on hearing it, is to pull the conversation well away from the "We're going to scale up across EMEA" stuff and back to the first prototype.

What's the first thing you could build to test the idea out? What could you learn by making a rough prototype and then getting some people to look at it, use it and react to it? Often you'll have your assumptions challenged and end up with new realisations about what you're supposed to be doing.

Just ge started. Do the first, tiny thing. The "Little Idea". Make the equivalent of putting some putty on your knife to make it easier to cut with. Apply that to whatever it is you're working on and then go from there.

##Start, then write the plan 

In my fast startup wen did this, to a degree. If I could go back I'd follow this approach even moreso. "why is it so hard to find a specific moment in a video?" was the problem.

I sketched up a solution in a browser in a afternoon that let you play though a Youtube video, type in text, and have it apprear at that point in the video. You could then search based on that text and find the bit you wanted. We showed it to some people, we wrote a business plan about how you could turn this Little Idea into something bigger -video is a huge market. And we got some investment very quickly to follow through on developing that into a business.

Without that early experiment we wouldn't have know waht it was that we were trying to do, and we learnt very quickly what was, and wasn't in the plan.

More close to home, my wife Emily had a Little, Big Idea recently. Subscription boxes are a big deal in the States, but not yet in the UK or Europe. She thought it would be interesting to see if she could get a craft subscription box off the ground. I spent a couple of hours making her a logo, she wrote on blog post, no website, no big plan required, and now she has a little business, the Crafty Fox Box, growing. She's had to learn as she's gone along, but rather than taking months to get the idea perfect, she just started it. It's a liberating way of doing things, and she's already started her second, a stationery subscription box: paper.do 

##Be immediate

When you've got a Big Idea, you're always thinking about it, and if you focus on just making that first step, you're maximising on that passion and energy. It's pointless trying to do a Big Idea when you're not passionate about it, and the main problem I see with the "write it all down, spend a year getting lots of documents together" model is that your passion isn't going to be in it. It's formula for making sure that you're tired of it before you've even spoken to any users.

I often care myself when I've had an idea by putting it out almost immediately on the web. I tweet something like "Hey guys! I'm looking for some people who know about x to help beta test an idea. Let me know". It's exciting, and you get great feedback. We're doing this at Makeshift, where we come up with a product idea, do a two week hack,
