I like learning guy, so, maybe I should follow Scott's steps.

Here we go:

The MIT Challenge:

My friend Scott Young recently finished an astounding feat: he completed add 33 courses in MIT's fabled computer science curriculum, from Linear Algebra to Theory of Computation, in less than one year. More importantly, he did it all on his own, watching the lectures online and evaluating himself using the actual exams. (See Scott's FAQ page for the details of how he ran this challenge.)

That works out to around 1 course every 1.5 weeks.

As you know, I'm convinced that the ability to master complicated information quickly is crucial for building a remarkable career (see my new book as well as here and here). So, naturally, I had to ask Scott to share his secrets with us. Fortunately, he agreed.

Below is a detailed guest post, written by Scott, that drills down the exact techniques he used (including specific examples) to pull off his MIT Challenge.

Take it away Scott...

##How I Tamed MIT's Computer Science Curriculum, By Scott Young

I've always been excited by the prospect of learning faster. Being good at things matters. Expertise and mastery give you the career capital to earn more money and enjoy lifestyle perks. If being good is the goal, learning is how you get there.

Despite the advantages of learning faster, most people seem reluctant to learn how to learn. Maybe it's because we don't believe it's possible, that learning speed is solely the domain of good genes or talent.
